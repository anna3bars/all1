 the difference between canActivate route guard and CanActivateChild route guard is - 
 is that when we use CanActivate route guard on a routeer, that route guard is only 
 applied to that router, it is not applies to its child routes. But when
 we use CanActivateChild route guard on a route, in that case that route guard 
 will be applied to all the child routes, it will not get applied to the 
 parent route
