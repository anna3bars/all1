 when the angular project starts when it runs first it load
 index.html file in browser

 runtime.js -> webpack runtime file <br> 
 // վեբ փաթեթի գործարկման ժամանակի ֆայլ //
</p>
<p>
 polyfills.js -> it is polyfills script fpr supporting the variety [բազմազանություն]
 of the latest modern browsers, basically not al the browsers can support the 
 modern JavaScript. So in order to make them supported in older browsers 
 what we need to do is we need to polyfill them
</p>
<p>
 main.js -> is basically the code of application <br>
 We are going to write our angular application in ts but 
 when we will compile that ts code it will be converted into js so 
 this main.js it is going to contain  that js code 
</p>
<p>
 then there is another js file which gets injected [ներարկվել է] by the angular cli 
 called as vendor.js and vendor.js contains the scripts 
 from the angular core library and also the other third-party 
 liabraries which we are using in our angular application 
</p>
<p>
 style.css -> but the style.css it will be first bundled [փաթեթավորված] into a js code and 
 then it will be injected to index.html 
</p>
<h4>
 the angular cli uses webpack as a module bundler [փաթեթավորող], so basically webpack 
 is a bundler which scans our application looking js files and merges them into one js file 
</h4>
<p>
 webpack has the ability  to bundle any kind of files like it can bundle 
 js file, css files, images, html etc...
</p>
<h2>
 And once the angular cli has these bundled [ներարկել] files, it injects the bundle 
 js and css files in the index.html

 now from where angular will come to know what is the <br>
 entry point [մուտքի կետ] <br> for that angular 
 application -> <br> 
 for that it searches the angular.json file
</p>

<p>
 from here now angular will go to main.ts file

<p>
 this platformBrowserDynamic is a module responsible for loading the angular application 
 in the desktops browser , <br>
 so angular application can be bootstrapped in many ways and in many platforms,
 for example we can also load our angular application in mobile devices with ionic 
 or native script , so if we are using native script then we will be using platform 
 native script dynamic <br>
 But since we want to run this application in the browser we are using  platformBrowserDynamic 
</p>
<h2>
 the angular application is organized as modules, every application build in angular 
 must have at least one module !!!!!!!!!!!!
</h2>
<p class="descrip">
 and the module which gets loaded first when the application is 
 loaded in the browser is called as root module
</p>
<p>
 line 6 ->  will load the app.module.ts
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/ang16/bootstraping/08.png" width="100%" alt="">
<h4>app.module.ts</h4>
<p>
 declarations -> in this we need to specify the directives components,
  pipes which belongs to this app module
</p>
<p>
 imports -> all external [արտաքին] modules which is required dfor this 
 angular application and standalone components
</p>
<p>
 providers -> we register all our services of our angular application
</p>
<p>
 bootstrap -> we specify the components that the angular should load 
 when this app module is loaded <br>
 and the component which we specify here that component must be a part 
 of this module
